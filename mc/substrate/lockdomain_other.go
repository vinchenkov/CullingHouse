// platformMountinfo reports "no mount table here", which GuardLockDomain reads
// as accept. That is a SCOPE decision, not a weakening.
//
// There is no /proc to consult off Linux, so a real check is impossible — but
// it is also unnecessary, because on macOS/Windows a native host process
// cannot open the spine at all: the bytes live inside the container runtime's
// VM, in a different kernel, with no host path to the file (Inv. 24, spec
// §11.5). Host components reach the spine by invoking the real `mc` INSIDE the
// lock domain, and that in-container process is Linux, where the guard runs
// for real.
//
// The one thing that opens a spine natively on darwin is the test suite, which
// builds throwaway spines in t.TempDir() on APFS. Making the guard refuse
// those would not protect anything — a temp file no container ever opens has
// no second kernel to race — it would only delete the fast lane.
//
// Do NOT "fix" this by adding an env-var escape hatch on the Linux side. The
// Linux path is exactly where a real spine is opened by more than one process,
// which is the only place the invariant can actually be violated. (The
// unexported openMountinfo variable is not that hatch: it is settable only
// from this package's own tests, which is what pins the guard's wiring given
// that this file makes the fast lane's platform inert.)
