// assertOwnedByInvoker checks that a file written from inside a container by
// uid 10002 arrives on the host owned by the OPERATOR who ran the test.
//
// This is the surprising half of the final-uid canary, and the reason it is
// asserted rather than assumed: on Docker Desktop's VirtioFS share the host
// inode is created with the sharing user's ownership, NOT the container uid.
// That is what lets a landing merge into an operator repository and leave
// operator-owned bytes behind with nothing chowning anything.
//
// If this ever flips to 10002, the operator ends up with unowned files in their
// own repository, and the design's no-permission-widening posture
// (ADR-017:76-86) stops being sufficient on its own.
