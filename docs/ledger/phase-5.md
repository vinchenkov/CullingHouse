# Phase 5 ledger — operator-scheduled real-subscription acceptance

Append-only history; never a startup read. One heading per session.

## (opened 2026-07-22)

Opened at Phase 4 close (d0ef4bb, all lanes green). Phase 5 work is
operator-present by design: live provider credentials (refresh grants +
token_url/client_id extraction), the production install bootstrap (warm
helper provisioning order — see IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES 2026-07-22), the
one-time launchd load, initiative production mount rows (ADR-023 D6), and
the S7 sleep drill. Nothing here starts without the operator's go.
